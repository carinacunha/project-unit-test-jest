# Project Unit Tests

In this project, several functions were implemented to solve the proposed requirements and/or unit tests to ensure that the implementations of the functions are correct. The following topics were made:

* Unit tests using the NodeJS Jest module to verify the correct functioning of the functions;
* Functions so that they meet already implemented tests;
* Tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.
